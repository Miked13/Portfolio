                    Iâ€™m a Full Stack Web Developer with a penchant for back-end development and enjoys
                    making functional and user-friendly websites. I have a Bachelor of Science in
                    Computer Science and have some experience in creating web applets that are
                    displayed on my online portfolio that I acquired from a Full Stack Web Developer
                    program from Georgia Tech coding bootcamp. A strong understanding of not only
                    Javascript, HTML and CSS but also knowledge of server-side languages
                    (PHP, MySQL,etc....), Version Control and APIs for Front-End and Back-End
                    development are required to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I like working
                    on projects from scratch and come up with a functional user-friendly end product.
                    I had no knowledge in web development prior to university, but the interest to work
                    in the technology industry was there. I would like to venture into mobile development
                    in the future, expand my knowledge on different programming languages and create
                    applications that can not only be used on any platforms but can also be helpful
                    utilities to common and rare problems.
